# MLS_Tasks2020
Repository for the Machine Learning and Statistics 2020 Module

This repository is the location for the Jupyter Notebook containing the answers to the tasks assigned for the Machine Learning and Statistics 2020 module for GMIT student Claire Nolan G00376464.

The notebook contains the question posed for each task followed by an answer describing the code used to get the answer, any references used and an explanation as to why the particular code was chosen.

**Question 1: Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places.**

**Question 2: The Chi-squared test for independence is a statisticalhypothesis test like a t-test. It is used to analyse whether two categorical variables are independent. The Wikipedia article gives the table below as an example, stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6. Use scipy.stats to verify this value and calculate the associated p value.**


**Question 3: The standard deviation of an array of numbers x is calculated using numpy as np.sqrt(np.sum((x - np.mean(x))**2)/len(x)) . However, Microsoft Excel has two different versions of the standard deviation calculation, STDEV.P and STDEV.S . The STDEV.P function performs the above calculation but in the STDEV.S calculation the division is by len(x)-1 rather than len(x) . Research these Excel functions, writing a note in a Markdown cell about the difference between them. Then use numpy to perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample.**

**Question 4 (original): Use scikit-learn to apply k-means clustering to Fisher’s famous Iris data set. You will easily obtain a copy of the data set online.**

**Question 4 (updated): Use scikit-learn to apply k Nearest Neighbours clustering to Fisher’s famous Iris data set. **
